sort the different articles: go through descriptions in sujet1

go over the commands in cahier des charges to check

admin can see who borrowed such article through select button
edit button: for existing articles, to modify title, author, quantity...
delete button: only admin can access, erases all data, WARNING messages upon click on delete and when you say I wanna delete "are you sure" + options: cancel, delete(definite), move to storage(no display, only data kept, can be recovered) 

add user screen: users can only borrow and give back articles, and browse through

why is Article class not used after declaration?
>>pass it through functions (edit, delete, select buttons ...)

update Library class (book/CD >> papercopy/vide/CD)
rewrite UML (video, papercopy) and shit

add special class for board games (?)

user window: reuse admin window + boolean for user/admin state and hide buttons from user
borrow/give back button for users (not for admin) 

replace all the cout with return and concatenate big string

backup before merging
