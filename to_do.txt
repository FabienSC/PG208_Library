sort the different articles: go through descriptions in sujet1

go over the commands in cahier des charges to check

seperate books from magazines (book synopsis, mag editor + articles indexing and titles)

add a boolean in user file (second line: 1 for admin, 0 for others)

admin can see who borrowed such article through select button
edit button: for existing articles, to modify title, author, quantity...
delete button: only admin can access, erases all data, WARNING messages upon click on delete and when you say I wanna delete "are you sure" + options: cancel, delete(definite), move to storage(no display, only data kept, can be recovered) 

add user screen: admin can add new users, decide if they are admin (new user button on login automatically makes normal users) and add articles...
users can only borrow and give back articles, and browse through

why is Article class not used after declaration?
>>pass it through functions (edit, delete, select buttons ...)

update Library class (book/CD >> papercopy/vide/CD)
rewrite UML (video, papercopy) and shit

check warning in article.h (delete function)

add special class for board games (?)
