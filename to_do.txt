fort the different articles: go through descriptions in sujet1
add "ressources numériques" (and special class for board games ?)
go over the commands in cahier des charges to check

add a boolean in user file (second line: 1 for admin, 0 for others)

admin can see who borrowed such article through select button
edit button: for existing articles, to modify title, author, quantity...
delete button: only admin can access, erases all data, WARNING messages upon click on delete and when you say I wanna delete "are you sure" + options: cancel, delete(definite), move to storage(no display, only data kept, can be recovered) 

add user screen: admin can add new users, decide if they are admin (new user button on login automatically makes normal users) and add articles...
users can only borrow and give back articles, and browse through

why is Article class not used afgted declaration?

update Library class (book/CD >> papercopy/vide/CD)
rewrite UML (video, papercopy) and shit

ASK TEACHER : must we have a single file for the library content, or is one file for each article ok ?

ASK TEACHER : do we REALLY need to do it on terminal, or can we just finish what we started...?
